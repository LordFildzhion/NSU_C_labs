# Topological sort

This algorithm topologically sorts the directed graph given by n by the number of vertices, m by the number of edges, and the next m troques contain an "edge start/ edge end" pair.

Example №1:

Input:
```
3
2
1 2
1 3
```

Output:
```
1 2 3
```

Example №2:

Input:
```
6
10
5 4
2 4
6 1
5 2
6 4
2 1
5 6
3 1
6 2
5 1
```

Output:
```
5 6 3 2 4 1
```
